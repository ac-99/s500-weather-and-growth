# s500-weather-and-growth

This project exploits year-to-year temperature and precipitation variation to estimate the effects of weather on economic growth using fixed effects methods, a la Dell (2012), for S500 Development Economics, a course completed as part of the MPhil in Economic Research at the University of Cambridge. The essay itself, which discusses the project at length, is not included in this repo; it may be possible to include this after the conclusion of the degree. 

This essay exploits year-to-year temperature and precipitation variation to estimate the effects of weather on economic growth using fixed effects methods, a la Dell (2012). This essay hypothesises, based on a large volume of micro-level evidence, that agricultural effects mediate the relationship between weather and economic growth. This problem is analysed using fixed effects regression methods, using dynamic measures for poverty and agriculture, rather than the static measures used by Dell 2021. This analysis is based on a US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) dataset with over 90 million observations from over 15,000 weather stations and World Bank Development Indicators between 1992 and 2017.

The short timescale of this project means that it has some important limitations to keep in mind (discussed at length in the essay):
* no population weighting scheme was used;
* unbalanced stations and non-random sampling of weather across countries;
* limited data availability in early years in the dataset;
* limited ability to use all entity and time effect interactions.
